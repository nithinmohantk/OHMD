# Challenge 1 - Team Setup

## Background

Office 365 and Azure have seen dramatic growth in the enterprise. Office 365 now has 100M+ monthly active commercial users and the Microsoft Cloud is leveraged by 90% of the Fortune 500. These technologies will serve as your developer playground for this OpenHack. Along the way, you will leverage some great Azure "serverless" technologies such as Azure Functions, Event Grid, and Logic Apps.

Microsoft Teams is the latest addition to Office 365, and it has been positioned as Microsoft's primary investment in cloud communications. Challenge 1 sets out to ensure you understand the very basics of Office 365 and Microsoft Teams. In the challenge, you will perform some basic operations such as updating your profile photo, forming a team, and side-loading an application into Microsoft Teams. If you are familiar with Microsoft Teams, this challenge should take no time and move your team to the "developer" tasks at the heart of OpenHack.

## Challenge

Each team member should sign into the Microsoft Teams with the Office 365 account provided and change their profile photo (to be used later in the OpenHack). Next, provision one team for your OpenHack group in Microsoft Teams (NOT one per team member). To pass this challenge, the group must also side-load the OpenHack app into Microsoft Teams using the application package provided below.

## Success Criteria

- Everyone on your team must use Microsoft Teams to upload a profile photo for the Office 365 account that was provided to them.

- As a group, you must provision one team in Microsoft Teams to collaborate in.

- Your team must side-load the [OpenHack app package](https://msopenhack.azurewebsites.net/Manifest/OpenHackValidationApp.zip) into your team in Microsoft Teams.

## Important Notes

- If you are an existing Office 365 subscriber or part of an organization that uses Azure Active Directory, you should consider using an incognito or in-private browser window for the OpenHack.

- The OpenHack app performs automated validation of your team's progress through the OpenHack. **Do not side-load the app into other teams**.
